                <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                  - I just learnt (once again) that I am not so patient with myself when I am so patient with others :)                <br>
                <h3>
                  What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?               
                </h3>
                <p>
                  - A good sense of empathy enables learners to build a sense of security and stronger relationship with other team members by encouraging tolerance and acceptance of others.
                  <br>
                  - Self-awareness provides learners with a way to look not just at their challenges but also to see what they are good at. This is facilitated by building positive self-esteem by understanding themselves better.                </p>

                <h3>
                  What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  - It was so useful researching and learning about the matters (core contents) that I do not usually have a chance to be aware of.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  - I would say being generous to myself was quite tough.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  - I think EDA is trying to teach students that web development is not solely about coding. The school also supports the student to reshape their mind to grow as a better programmers and a better humans.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
                </h3>
                <p>
                  - One may not see learning core as a necessary part of learning web development. But once they understand why EDA encourages students to learn it then the mist of doubt shall be lifted.

                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                <p>
                  - Generally, intelligence is the ability to learn new concepts and apply your knowledge to problems. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is similar but it is the ability to learn and understand about yourself as well as the others. 
                  Daniel Goleman, an American psychologist, suggest that EQ consists of 5 components – <strong>Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy and Social skills.</strong></p>

                <h3>
                  How is it different to IQ?                
                </h3>
                <p>
                  - As described before, EQ accounts for how you understand yourself and other people e.g. their feelings.
                  Intelligence quotient (IQ) on the other focuses on measuring intelligence that includes analytical, problem-solving abilities and logic. Since it is designed to measure intellectual intelligence, it is given as a score from a series of tests (Higher IQ = better ability to learn). It has been known that higher academic scores are achieved by people with higher IQ than those with lower IQ scores without exerting more effort.

                <h3>
                  Why is it important?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  - Although IQ is a good indication that measures peoples’ ability to learn it has no connection with how people understand the emotions of their own and other people’s. Have you seen anyone who is super smart and clever but lacks an understanding of other people and has no idea how to deal with them?                  - On the other hand, I sometimes lose self-confidence when I face a big challenge. However, this will not be the case for learning at EDA as I know I will become a developer at the end of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  - We, humans, are social animals :)We form a connection and a community. Our lives would be more fruitful if we can build strong relationships! Well-developed EQ will bring satisfaction to your job and personal life. In the big picture, everyone wins if we all can try to understand other people better and help those around us achieve their success.

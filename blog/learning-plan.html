                  <br>

                  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - I will devote myself to work every day and will not let any work pile on:)
                  <br>
                  - Will try to take some breaks in between.
                  <br>
                  - Will not undermine other people's learning opportunities and discourage them.
                  <br>

                  What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - I don’t think this will happen to me unless I become lazy.
                  <br>
                  - If it happens, it is all on me and will work even harder.
                </p>

                <p>
                  - If I face an obstacles during the working hours I will try to seek help from the facilitators!
                    <br>
                  - If it is outside of the working hours then I will google and ask my fellow cohort buddies.

                <h4>

                </h4>
                <p>
                  - From my previous experience, learning becomes fun and you seek more challenge when I had enthusiastic teachers so.. probably something similar along that line would be great :)
                </p>
                  <br>
                <h4>
                  Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

                <p>
                  - Lucky I do not have any responsibilities that force me to gap a large time block.
                  <br>
                  - I only have a daily workout session that I do at home so will conduct it wisely.

                <h4>1. were blocked on a simple problem.</h4>
                <h4>
                  What was the problem?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - While I was working on my blog for the first time the CSS did not work as intended :’)                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  What problem-solving techniques did you use?                
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - Googling!                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  How did you feel throughout the process?                
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - It felt like filtering out and searching for a small piece from a vast amount of information.                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  What did you learn?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - I learnt that the problem I will be facing throughout the course would probably have been dealt by many other people around the world and different approaches to solve that specific problem are highly likely to be available on the internet.
                  <br><br>
                  - I just need to develop my own way to filter out and find what suits me the best.
                </p>

                  What was the problem?                
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - The code I wrote for one of the JS challenges was not working and I could not figure out why!!                
                </p>
                <br>

                  - Console logging
                  <br>
                  It allowed me to track of what was actually being returned from the code block (so useful!)
                  <br>
                  - Pseudocoding and the rubber ducky method   
                  <br>
                  Try to break problems and goals that I wanted to achieve into smaller pieces and tried to explain what had to be done to achieve each little point.             
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  How did you feel throughout the process?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - I felt good as I was able to see what was really not working.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  What did you learn?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - I realised that console logging is a very crucial part of the debugging process and should make a good habit of using it more often.

                <h4>
                  Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - From what I read about neuroplasticity and its principles, 
                  I am not too sure how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity would 
                  directly benefit people. However, if our brains are capable of changing 
                  themselves throughout our lifetime becoming more resilient and enabling us 
                  to overcome neurological illnesses as research suggests, 
                  then I think it is great to be aware of these principles and try to 
                  remember them to maximize the change.                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.                
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - Remodelling my brain does not sound like an easy task but something 
                  that I would like to take along with my journey to become a developer. 
                  I would probably read through all the principles carefully and will 
                  remember them every time I face a difficult challenge. “Difficult challenges 
                  will not kill me but will only help to re-shape my brain to become a better developer”.               
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?               
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - Learning something difficult. <br>
                  - Revise what I have learnt. <br>
                  - Put me in a difficult situation and try to solve it from different angles. <br>            
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.                </h4>
                <p>
                  - I have not found any but will update it when I find one!
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Research Growth Mindset
                </h3>
                <h4>
                  Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - To understand what a growth mindset is I think it would be good to go through the opposite first “fixed mindset”.
                  <br>
                  - A fixed mindset is something when someone believes that their skills, talents and traits are fixed. What you know and what you are capable of will not change hence, you will not be able to learn anything new.
                  <br>
                  - A growth mindset, on the other hand, is when you take learning and challenges as opportunities. You believe that failure is an opportunity to learn and grow. People with a growth mindset (like myself!) focus on progress and process to stretch their existing abilities.
                  <br>
                  - It is hugely relevant to learning coding although I have never dealt with coding in my life I still believe I can suss it and change my career in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                  - The code I wrote for one of the JS challenges was not working and I could not figure out why!!                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?                </h4>
                <p>
                  - I did not realise a growth mindset was a thing out there. But good to know that research has been conducted on this.                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>
                  How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  - It is easy to face a wall (a huge one) and lost faith in yourself throughout the coding journey. One might also think that coding is too tech for them. But even as a developer, I know I will face challenges every day and will have to deal with them to become a greater Dev. Everything is just a part of the journey that I shall enjoy.                </p>

                  Blend with your learning plan and strategies
                </h3>
                <h4>
                  Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.

                <p>
                  - I guess there is no shortcut to learning to code. You just need to practice and practice. Try to deal with as many problems as possible. But more importantly, you need to believe in yourself that you can become a great developer at the end of the journey. Of course, it requires me to put my 100% effort. It may feel foreign throughout the journey keep on believing that my brain is slowly adapting to it and I have the potential to suss it!

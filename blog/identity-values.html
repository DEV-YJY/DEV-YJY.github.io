            <h3>My core personal values</h3>
            <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h4>
            <p>
              - In my previous job where I worked as QA/R&D personnel there was a situation when everyone was preparing for a new product launch with a tight deadline. However, an error was made in the production during the manufacture and one raw material was accidentally added ten times its normal quantity. Due to the nature of the production capacity, we could not fix the problem by adding an extra amount of other ingredients to match the raw material that was overly added. The majority of people were hoping to manufacture a few new batches by mixing them with the portion of the compromised batch to save time and cost. However, I did not feel comfortable with such an approach as there is no guarantee that the compromised batch will deliver the even amount of ingredients that were added. Moreover, it was for human consumption so there was a product quality/safety issue associated with this incident. Therefore, I suggested to manufacture a new batch without using the compromised batch. As a result, our product launch did not meet the date and had to get rid of the old batch which resulted in the company the extra cost. However, we were able to maintain confidence in our products.

            <h4>
              Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
            </h4>
            <p>
              - As I was born in South Korea and lived there for about 13 years, I was exposed to South Korean culture in my early childhood. It taught me to be kind to others, especially to my friends and neighbours. This allowed me to further extend my concern to the community. All this together has provided a good foundation for my identity and to be who I am right now. I value my happiness as well as other people’s happiness. I wish I could make everyone’s life happier and make this planet a happier place to live. I am intending to contribute to this through my IT skills.

            <h3>
              My Strengths and Limitations
            </h3>
            <h4>
              Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
            </h4>
            <p>
              - I would say my strength is that I can sit down and dig into things for a long time. This has allowed me to learn different things without losing focus. Also, I like trying out new things and facing different challenges. I guess that is why I am here answering these questions right now.<br>
              - On the other hand, I sometimes lose self-confidence when I face a big challenge. However, this will not be the case for learning at EDA as I know I will become a developer at the end of it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
              Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
            </h4>
            <p>
              - On top of what I have mentioned previously, I have the ability to stay calm under pressure and in a difficult situations. Hope this will enable me to calmly assess the problems and situation to come up with the best solution without being swept away by different obstacles. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
              Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
            </h4>
            <p>
              - I usually escalate such problems to my superior. It has always solved the problem instantly without getting me emotionally involved or my time wasted. If I find myself in such a situation again during EDA course, I will probably take a strategy that I used to take back in University by trying to talk to the opponents. As web development/software development is all about co-working.
